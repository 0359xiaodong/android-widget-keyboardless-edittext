KeyboardlessEditText
====================

A native Android EditText, except that no keyboard will appear when user interacts with it. All other edit operations still work.

Users will still have the ability to select, cut, copy, and paste using this widget.

Included in this repo:
1. An easy-to-use stand-alone KeyboardlessEditText.java that you can just copy into your project. (Has no dependencies)
2. A sample app that demonstrates the use of the keyboardless EditText, including input buttons and backspace.
